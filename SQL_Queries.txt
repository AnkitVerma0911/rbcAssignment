Given the tables, the SQL queries would look like:

1. Gets all the clients and its details for a given Advisor.

SELECT c.*, a.*
FROM [Client Details] AS c
INNER JOIN ClientAdvisor as ca
ON c.ClientId = ca.ClientId
INNER JOIN Advisor AS a
ON ca.AdvisorId = a.AdvisorId
WHERE a.name = ‘someName’;

2. Gets the details of all total number of accounts associated with all advisors.

SELECT a.name, COUNT(*) as numberOfAccounts
FROM Advisor AS a
FULL OUTER JOIN ClientAdvisor as ca
ON a.AdvisorId = ca.AdvisorId
GROUP BY a.name;
